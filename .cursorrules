# Cursor Rules for Faramesh Core

## Git Operations

When the user asks to commit, push, or release:

1. **Quick Push**: Use `./scripts/quick-push.sh "message"` or `make push MSG="message"`
2. **Quick Release**: Use `./scripts/quick-release.sh VERSION "notes"` or `make release VERSION=x.y.z`
3. **Always check status first**: `make status` or `git status`

## Code Style

- Use ruff for linting and formatting
- Follow PEP 8 with 100 char line length
- Use type hints where possible
- Run `make lint` before committing

## Testing

- Run `make test` before pushing
- Write tests for new features
- Keep test coverage high

## Commits

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused (one logical change per commit)

## Releases

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Tag releases with `v` prefix (e.g., `v0.2.1`)
